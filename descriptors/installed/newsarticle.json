Sometimes only a placename is provided.<br/><br/>\n\nStructured representations of dateline-related information can also be expressed more explicitly using <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/locationCreated\">locationCreated</a> (which represents where a work was created e.g. where a news report was written).  For location depicted or described in the content, use <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/contentLocation\">contentLocation</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nDateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than towards automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some examples: \"BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2.\", \"Paris, France\", \"December 19, 2017 11:43AM Reporting from Washington\", \"Beijing/Moscow\", \"QUEZON CITY, Philippines\".","rdfs:label":"dateline"}]}
