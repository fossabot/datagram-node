## Get started

```
$ npx datagram // open datagram without installing

// or

## What is Datagram
Servers used to be about running code and storing backups. Now they are about facilitating connections and serving data. Yet big part of the work is spent on running and maintaining all the plumbing that goes into facilitating various data transfer needs between the users and the service.

We all have spent too many configuring Linux, setting up databases, figuring out a good way to save your data in the database and then writing a custom backend code to serve the data. 

Datagram solves this by offering a framework to build a "server" from the container definition you give it. You can run Datagram on any x86 or ARM based computer and it supports both client-server and peer-to-peer connection models out-of-the-box.

> [Datagram is not a blockchain](docs/NOT_A_BLOCKCHAIN.md).

There are currently +10 container definitions available and different +1500 data descriptors.
